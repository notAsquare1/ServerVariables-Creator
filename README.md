This is a plugin to help you make variable creation easy with ServerVariables! Here are the commands you can use:
```
/svc create <variable-name> <variable-type:GLOBAL|PLAYER> <value-type:INTEGER|TEXT|DOUBLE> <initial-value>

/svc delete <variable-name>

/svc edit <variable-name> <property:variable_type|value_type|initial_value> <new-value>

/svc gui

/svc reload [full]
```
The GUI will only work if it is enabled in the config AND you have the plugin CommandPanels installed! You might have to reload CommandPanels on the first time using the GUI, but otherwise, the plugin will place the GUI file into the panels folder for you.

This plugin was tested on 1.21.3 and may not work on other versions, but it should be compatible with 1.18.2+ and if not then please report it as an issue.
